Libft - Custom C Library 

Libft is a custom C library that re-implements essential functions from the standard C library, along with additional utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, linked list handling, and more.
This library serves as a foundation for more complex projects by providing efficient, self-built versions of core functions like strlen, strcpy, memset, and calloc.
Itâ€™s a foundational project designed to reinforce an understanding of low-level programming and memory management in C.

Let me know if you'd like to highlight specific features or functions you implemented!

NOTE :  i have some cases that i did not handle of course  ! and it my be  a memory leak  in a function  . but  i will hadle it later !
